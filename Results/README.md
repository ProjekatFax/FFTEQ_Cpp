# FFTEQ_Cpp

There are 3 branches the main branch is the implementation
The branch bit_analysis is made for doing the bit analysis on three separate vectors. 
The branch generate_samples is used for generating the three separate vectors from the 3 basic eq configurations. 
By saving the generated 3 samples going to the bit_analysis branch doing the analysis we will git the results. For the bit analysis.

Then we will need to do the virtual platform. Excercise 12 We will open a new branch for that from the main branch and edit that.
